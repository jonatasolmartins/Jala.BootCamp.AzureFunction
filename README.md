# Jala.BootCamp.AzureFunction
This is a repository created during the class that I taught the students of the second class of bootcamp Brasil Jalasoft/Jala-university about Azure functions. 
It contains an example on how to create a function to serve as a backend to Alexa skill, how to publish to and read from a queue using an web api and a azure function.
